    "In this notebook I will solve the Unity ML [Reacher Environment](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) using [Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/silver14.pdf) (DDPG). See the [README](https://github.com/bobflagg/Continuous-Control/blob/master/README.md) for instructions on how to setup your environment to run the code here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the reacher environment for the Continuous Control Project a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of the agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.\n",
    "The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.\n",
    "The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, an agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iâ€™ll solve the distributed version of the task which contains 20 identical agents, each with its own copy of the environment.  The solution borrows code from the [course solution](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/ddpg-bipedal) to the [BipedalWalker-v2 Gym Environment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/BipedalWalker-v2/)."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Unity ML Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) is a *sequential decision making problem*, in which an agent interacts with an environment over discrete time steps and tries to find a policy to maximize the expected discounted return:\n",
    "$$G_t = \\sum_{\\tau=t}^{\\infty}\\gamma^{\\tau-t}R_\\tau,$$\n",
    "where $\\gamma\\in [0, 1]$ is a discount factor that trades-off the importance of immediate and future rewards. See [Sutton and Barto](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html) for a general discussion of this sort of problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I'll focus on policy-based methods, which try to directly find an optimal policy, $\\pi^*$, that an agent can use to decide what actions to take.  The particular algorithm, \n",
    "[Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/silver14.pdf) (DDPG), is motivated by an important connection between the action selected by an optimal policy and the ***optimal action-value function***:\n",
    "\t$$Q^*(s, a) =  \\max_{\\pi}Q^{\\pi}(s,a).$$\n",
    "Namely, if you know the optimal action-value function, then in any given state, $s$, an optimal action can be found by solving\n",
    "\t $$\\pi^*(s) = \\arg\\max_a Q^*(s,a).$$\n",
    "DDPG concurrently learns an approximator to $Q^*(s,a)$ and an approximator to $\\pi^*(s)$, and it does so in a way which is specifically adapted for environments with continuous action spaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning $Q^*(s,a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point for approximating $Q^*(s, a)$  is the **Bellman Equation**:\n",
    "$$Q^{*}(s,a) = \\mathbb{E}\\big[R_{t+1}+\\gamma\\cdot\\max_{a'}Q^{*}(S_{t+1},a')| S_t = s, A_t=a\\big].$$\n",
    "Suppose we are approximating $Q^*(s, a)$ with a neural network, $Q_\\phi(s,a)$, and we have collected a set $\\mathcal{D}$ of\n",
    "transitions $(s, a, r, s', d)$, then the **mean-squared Bellman error** (MSBE)\n",
    "\t\t$$L(\\phi, \\mathcal{D}) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{D}}\\big[\\big(Q_\\phi(s,a)-(r+\\gamma\\cdot(1-d)\\max_{a'}Q_\\phi(s',a'))\\big)^2\\big]$$\n",
    "tells us roughly how closely $Q_{\\phi}$ comes to satisfying the Bellman equation and so can serve as the loss function in tuning $\\phi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning $\\pi^*(s)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning the optimal policy is pretty simple: we want to learn a deterministic policy $\\pi^*(s)$ which gives the action that maximizes $Q^*(s, a)$.  This suggests using the loss function\n",
    "    $$L(\\theta, \\mathcal{D}) = -\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{D}}\\big[Q_\\phi(s,\\pi_\\theta(s))\\big]$$\n",
